Our paper  on "CAP regression" is to appear in [Biostatistics](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/425033v1), with an R package  [here](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cap). This is  a joint work with my wonderful collaborators Yi Zhao from Indiana University,  and Bingkai Wang,  Stewart Mostofsky, and Brian Caffo from Johns Hopkins.
